        <p>This project's goal was to create a smart home app that features controls for lighting, music, temperature, and cameras within a home. For this project, I designed the entire interface from scratch. I began by conducting visual research of popular smart home apps, such as Apple Home and Google Home. I followed this with building wireframes of each screen. I needed each screen to be easily glanceable, as the intended use is for a wall-mounted smart home interface. I also followed usability heuristics such as visibility of system status through the vertical navigation, and match between system and real world through iconography to provide a seamless and accessible experience.</p>
