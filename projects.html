        <h3>Smart Home App</h3>
        <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F5qHWdBxImDB1EmGmZYmJx5%2FSmart-Home-App%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D1%253A6%26t%3DZHI3GyyIIJtYJniJ-1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This project's goal was to create a smart home app that features controls for lighting, music, temperature, and cameras within a home. For this project, I designed the entire interface from scratch. I began by conducting visual research of popular smart home apps, such as Apple Home and Google Home. I followed this with building wireframes of each screen. I needed each screen to be easily glanceable, as the intended use is for a wall-mounted smart home interface. I also followed usability heuristics such as visibility of system status through the vertical navigation, and match between system and real world through iconography to provide a seamless and accessible experience.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this project was to create a streaming service using the brand guidelines provided by the client. I decided to choose Discord, because I am already quite familiar with the brand and I felt their brand guidelines worked well for a streaming app. I used the colors, typography, logo, and voice outlined in Discord's official brand guidelines to adhere to the client's vision. I also designed the inteface for TV, tablet, and handheld device screen sizes.</p>

        <h3>Responsive Design Website</h3>
        <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FBUCU8QvdPSc6YeKVh5sIKw%2FVoting-Website%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D34%253A199%26t%3D29dd9NP7S2QyjS0E-1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to build a webpage that would be responsive to various device sizes from a wireframe. I began by creating a wireframe for mobile (known as "mobile-first" design), then proceeded to stylize the desktop and mobile designs from there. I learned a lot about the importance of properly positioning content based on how much horizontal space is available in order to keep information organized.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this project was to build a multi-step checkout process using the design system provided by the client. I decided to choose GitLab's Pajamas design system, as I already use Github to host this website. This project taught me how to use a design system to ensure consistency across the client's entire product line.</p>

        <h3>Product Page</h3>

        <p>The purpose of this project was to utlize sketching, ideation, and gestalt principles to create the product page for a tea company client. I learned a lot about the importance of proximity, similarity, closure, symmetry, hierarchy, contrast, and alignment while working on this project. I generated the images using OpenAI's DALL-E platform in order to create consistent and aesthetically pleasing imagery.</p>
